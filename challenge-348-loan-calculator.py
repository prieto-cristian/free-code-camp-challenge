# Loan Calculator
# Given a loan amount, annual interest rate percentage, and fixed monthly
# payment, return an array of remaining balances after each monthly payment
# until the loan is paid off.
#
# Each month, interest is calculated on the remaining balance using
# the monthly interest rate: (annual rate / 100) / 12, then the monthly
# payment is subtracted.
#
# Return each remaining balance rounded to the nearest dollar.
# Include the loan amount in the returned array. The first element in the
# array will always be the loan amount, and the last element of the array
# will always be 0.
#
# Tests:
# 1. get_loan_schedule(1000, 0, 200) should return [1000, 800, 600, 400, 200, 0].
# 2. get_loan_schedule(1000, 5, 200) should return [1000, 804, 608, 410, 212, 13, 0].
# 3. get_loan_schedule(10, 50, 1) should return [10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 5,
# 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0].
#
# 4. get_loan_schedule(5500, 8, 400) should return [5500, 5137, 4771, 4403,
# 4032, 3659, 3283, 2905, 2525, 2141, 1756, 1367, 977, 583, 187, 0].
#
# 5. get_loan_schedule(50000, 5.2, 1650) should return [50000, 48567, 47127,
# 45681, 44229, 42771, 41306, 39835, 38358, 36874, 35384, 33887, 32384, 30874,
# 29358, 27835, 26306, 24770, 23227, 21678, 20122, 18559, 16990, 15413, 13830,
# 12240, 10643, 9039, 7428, 5810, 4186, 2554, 915, 0].
